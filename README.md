# CellPose-Segmentation

## Main Result

Using pretrained SAM-CellPose model (https://pypi.org/project/cellpose) we segmented +30'000 cell nuclei. 

## Dataset
- Description of the biological application
  - This image data set contains a large number of segmented nuclei images and was created for the Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl. The image set was a testing ground for the application of novel and cutting edge approaches in computer vision and machine learning to the segmentation of the nuclei belonging to cells from a breadth of biological contexts.
